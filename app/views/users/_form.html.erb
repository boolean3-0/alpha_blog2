<%# This is a partial, as indicated by the _ in the file name.
Partials allow us to reuse code. %>

<%# Render the partial contained in views/shared/_errors.html.erb %>
<%# It displays errors messages. %>
<%# Note that we pass in @user as obj. We could simply reference @user in the _errors partial since
instance variables automatically get passed along to rendered partials, but since _errors is in the
/shared directory, we want to be able to run its code from multiple /view subdirectories. Thus,
we want _errors to be able to work with other objects that might have errors attached (e.g., @user).
Therefore, we pass in @user as obj. %>
<%= render 'shared/errors', obj: @user %>

<%#
Here we use a form_for helper.
For more info about form helpers in Rails, see:
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html
%>
<%# Note that the @user variable used below
must be initialized in UsersController. %>

<%# The styling below is based on the "horizontal form" code from the following page:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#forms %>
<div class="row">
    <div class='col-xs-12'>
        <%# If you look at the "horizontal form" code, it is wrapped in form tags with the class
        "form-horizontal". However we can't do this here because the embedded Ruby line below with
        the "form_for" function actually returns HTML with a form tag. Thus, if we also wrap the code
        in form tags like Bootstrap prescribes, we would have duplicate form tags, and Rails would give an error.
        The following line therefore is a workaround to add the "form-horizontal" class to our generated
        form tag. Note that we do need the "form-horizontal" class to get the styling we want. %>
        <%= form_for(@user, :html => {class: "form-horizontal", role: "form"}) do |f| %>
