// Normally the stuff done in this file would be done in application.css it seems, but
// in this case we are creating a custom version.
// See: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass
// Note that the course doesn't use the latest version of Bootstrap.

// If you want to make custom changes to the library Bootstrap makes available for you, such
// as making navigation bars a different color, you would do that here above the import statements in
// your custom css.scss file.

// "bootstrap-sprockets" must be imported before "bootstrap" and "bootstrap/variables"
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";
