// Normally the stuff done in this file would be done in application.css it seems, but
// in this case we are creating a custom version.
// See: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass
// Note that the course doesn't use the latest version of Bootstrap.

// If you want to make custom changes to the library Bootstrap makes available for you, such
// as making navigation bars a different color, you would do that here above the import statements in
// your custom css.scss file.
// Note that this is where you change default stylings--not stylings by id or class.
// The latter should be done below the import statements.

// Make the navigation bar blue by default
$navbar-default-bg: #08088A;

// "bootstrap-sprockets" must be imported before "bootstrap" and "bootstrap/variables"
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";

// To see the element that has id "logo", go the the _navigation.html.erb file.
